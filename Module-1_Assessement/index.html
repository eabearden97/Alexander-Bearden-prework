                    <p> Hi! My name is Alexander Bearden and I just recently graduated Macalester College as an economics major and a computer science minor. Throughout my four years here in the Twin Cities, I've grown to love Minnesota. It offers all the benefits of a big city with the same midwestern feel that I get back home in St. Louis. This certainly was a big part of my decision and I have not regretted it one bit. One day I can be at a fun restaurant in the city and another day I can be out fishing at a lake in the middle of nowhere. That's the kind of variety I was hoping to get when I decided to make the trek north to Minnesota and it has not disappointed me.

                    <p> Another very important part of my time here has been my experience on the baseball team. I certainly enjoy many sports, but baseball has always been my true passion and it was really a blessing to be able to continue playing for four years in college. Along the way, I made lifelong friendships with my teammates and coaches which allowed me to grow as a person and a player.

                    <p> Before coming to Macalester, I lived in St. Louis with my mom, dad, and sister. My sister is 3 years younger than me and is now going to school at Texas Christian University (TCU) in Fort Worth, Texas. I've been down to visit several times which is always a good time, especially while it's snowing up here.

                    <p> It was a lot of fun making this website and I certainly learned a lot. The further I got into the site's creation, the more I realized how truly powerful Bootstrap is as a tool: it's crazy to see how many things you can do and fun to test a lot of them out!
