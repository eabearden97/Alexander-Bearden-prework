# Hangman Game

### About This Project
This webpage is a hangman game with a unique baseball theme. The goal is to guess the word (that relates to baseball) by guessing one letter at a time. To get started, just press any key. Keep playing and see how many wins you can get!

### Specifics

The webpage includes several key items that are important for the game including...
* The last answer (whether you got it right or not) and a corresponding image
* The number of wins
* The current word you are trying to guess
* The number of guesses remaining (it doesn't count as a guess if you get the answer correct)
* The letters that have already been guessed

Once you either run out of guesses or get the answer right...
*  You will hear a **cheering** noise if you got the right answer
* You will hear a **"You're Out!** noise if you got the wrong answer
* You will see the answer of the last puzzle
* You will see an image corresponding to the answer of the last puzzle
* Your win total win go up by 1 if you got the answer right or will stay the same if you ran out of guesses
* A new puzzle (and therefore a new word to guess) will show up under "Current Word"
* Your guesses remaining will reset to 10
* Your "Letters Already Guessed" will reset
